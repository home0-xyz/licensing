# The People's License: How Home0 Uses PPL to Democratize Housing Transactions 🏠✊

At Home0, we're not just creating AI tools – we're lighting a fire under the broken real estate system. 🔥 That's why we've adopted the Peer Production License (PPL) – a radical license for a radical mission.

Our tech is FREE for:
- Our army of certified real estate agents acting as community stewards 🛡️
- Worker-owned cooperatives fighting the good fight 🌱
- Non-profits actually serving people, not shareholders 💪
- Anyone building housing justice from the ground up 🏘️

BUT – and this is a big BUT – corporate real estate vultures can KEEP OUT. 🚫 If you're a profit-hungry corporation built on exploitation and extraction, you don't get to use our tools. Period.

Why this approach? Because we're tired of seeing tech innovations get swallowed up by capitalism only to be weaponized against the very communities they could help. Not this time. 🙅

The PPL ensures our work remains in the commons where it belongs, while explicitly blocking parasitic real estate investors from co-opting our revolution. It's a direct challenge to the status quo that says everything must generate profit for the already wealthy.

Home0 isn't playing nice with the system – we're building the alternative. 🏗️ Our technology belongs to the people, not to Wall Street or Silicon Valley. 

Join the resistance. Housing is a human right, not a luxury good. 🔑✊
